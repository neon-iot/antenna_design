# ANTENNA DESIGN COURSE
## About this course
This is an antenna design course, thought to be taught during six weeks with a charge of 24 hours of lectures, 4 hours for consultations, and 4 hours for evaluation. This course will be approved by the realization of an antenna design project, the writing of a document about this design in paper format and the oral presentation of this work. 

The responsible for this course is Dr.-Ing. Benigno Rodríguez at FING/UDELAR, Montevideo, Uruguay. For any question you can contact him by email writing to: benigno@fing.edu.uy .

## What you will learn
The objective is to offer a small antenna design course, using a professional tool for this such as Computer Simulation Technology (CST) software.

This course aims to provide theoretical and practical training in the design, construction and measurement (characterization) of antennas.

## What you will need:
Previous knowledge required: A first course in antennas and propagation.

Recommended previous knowledge: Basic knowledge of Electronics (theoretical and practical).
